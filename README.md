# Phase 3 Project
## Project Basis
For my third Flatiron School project I've built an online store using SQLite, Ruby, and React. While not a full online store, Nora's Room (a play on Nordstrom) allows users to join as a user, write, edit, and delete reviews on various clothes. Since this was a backend focused project, the front end is geared mroe towards highlighting the data stored in the database as well as the various ways it can be displayed in react.
