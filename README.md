# Phase 3 Project
## Project Basis
For my third Flatiron School project I've built an online store using SQLite, Ruby, and React. While not a full online store, Nora's Room (a play on Nordstrom) allows users to join as a user, write, edit, and delete reviews on various clothes. Since this was a backend focused project, the front end is geared mroe towards highlighting the data stored in the database as well as the various ways it can be displayed in react. 

## Project Use
The main page of this project currently allows you to see various clothes on the main page, filter them by store location as well as clothing category, and read a review by pressing the "Read Reviews" button. You can also join as a user and see the other users in the users page and filling in the blank spaces. By double clicking on the clothes, you can see descriptions, sizing information, and care information at the top of the page. Below that, there are reviews where you can add your own reviews. After adding a review you can edit your last posted review or delete it all together. 

## How to Use
1. Click on the catetories in the top right to filter through the items.
